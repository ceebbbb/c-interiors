# FORM VALIDATION

The functionality of the form validation code is to elimate any errors that may occur when trying to submit a form that isn't completely filled out. The implementation of the code allows alert messages to present themselves on screen when a section of the from hasn't been filled in. This is so that the form has all the requird information when it is sent.

# IMAGE GALLERY SLIDESHOW

The functionality of the code is to make the images scroll left and right as well as scroll smoothly. The implementation of the code is by creating a 900px width container, creating two div's both 900px in width each and then adding a scrollContainer and an eventListener of "wheel" to scroll between the two div's with images on.

# ACCORDION 

The functionality of the accordion is to hide information on the main page that doesn't neccesserily have to be visible unless the user wishes to find out more information. This is also good for user experience as it allows them to interact with the web page rather than just scroll and read.

I implemented javascript into the code using an eventListener to toggle so when the user clicks on the heading, the contents inside are made visible.
